\section{Problem}
Generalized sudoku

\section{Emphasis}
SAT

\section{Direct Solution}
I found a solver online that was put into the public domain which almost supported generalized sudoku. I have done a few minor changes in order for it to read the same format that my other tools use, for example, being able to read a number larger than one digit. One trouble I have been having though is that this solver is not very fast in a lot of situations, but I have not been able to find any other solvers online for generalized sudoku.

\section{Specification-based Solution}
I am just using the specification provided on the course website, running it though the provided copy of Enfragmo. The input format is different than my tools, so instead of trying to make it somehow read the input format I want, I wrote a little program to take the input format I want and output the format the the specification expects.

\section{Benchmark Instance Families}
I've been working on a random generalized sudoku generator to use for one family of benchmarks.
