\section{Problem}
Investigating how different forms of CNF for generalized sudoku affect the speed in which different SAT solvers can show satisfiability.

\section{Emphasis}
My emphasis for this project is on using SAT solvers.

\section{Direct Solution}
I found a solver online\footnote{http://www.8325.org/sudoku/source.html} that was put into the public domain which almost supported generalized sudoku. I have done a few minor changes in order for it to read the same format that my other tools use, for example, being able to read a number larger than one digit. This solver is not the greatest direct solver that is available, but should represent a good baseline for how fast a direct solver will be.

\section{Specification-based Solution}
The specification being used is the one that has been provided on the course website. It is being run through the provided copy of Enfragmo. I have not included the copy of Enfragmo in the zip file as I do not want to distribute it anywhere. All my scripts assume that the provided binary is located in the users home directory. The input format is different than my tools, so instead of trying to make it somehow read the input format I want, I wrote a small program to take the input format I want and output the format the the specification expects.

\section{Benchmark Instance Families}
One family I use is randomly generated problems. There is a good generalized sudoku generator that I found online\footnote{http://ia.udl.cat/remository/Software/Sudoku-Generator/}. This generator has full control over how many empty spots there are on the sudoku board and I have found that it actually does generate interesting problems for the solvers to run. I wrote a set of scripts to run

\section{Emphasis On SAT}
\subsection{Methods}
Two methods of generating CNF formulas were generated for this problem. The first method is very simple. It uses 1 variable for each possible number on each square of the map. For a 16x16 sudoku this means it has a total of 4096 variables. The clauses for this one are for the most part very simple, consisting of only two variables each for most of the clauses. The second method is a lot more complicated. The idea for it came from the paper\footnote{http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mitchell/cmpt-417/2013-Spring/Readings/2-Malik-Zhang-CACM-SAT-Review.pdf} we were provided on solving graph colouring using binary. I use only four variables for each square on the board which represent the number in binary. For example if we have variables $a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, d = 0$ the value of the square would be $5$. This method works very well for 16x16 as no bits are wasted, unlike for a 9x9 puzzle as you would still need 4 bits to represent it. This has a huge advantage in the number of variables used for the problem as each square only needs 4, unlike my first method where they need 16, meaning the total number of variables for a 16x16 is only 1024. But, this comes at a cost in the formula that is generated as the clauses now all use at least eight variables, making it a lot harder to eliminate clauses from the formula.
\subsection{Solvers}
There are many SAT solvers out that that have been released as open source. Oddly enough, a large number of them seem to be based on MiniSat. I chose four SAT solvers that have done generally very well in past SAT competitions, which were also easy to build on my machine.

\section{Results}
\subsection{First Family}
The first benchmark family has a simple architecture, but provides very interesting data through running the solvers many times. Simply it generates a 16x16 sudoku puzzle randomly with N holes. N starts at 1 and increases by 5 up to 251. Each value of N is run 10 times. Solutions are not guaranteed to be unique, but they are generally not the easiest problems to solve. The following graph shows
