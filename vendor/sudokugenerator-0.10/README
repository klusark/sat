using one of the 3 methods there explained. There are 3 helper scripts in scripts/ showing usage of this program.

generatesudoku.sh  - Generates a Sudoku in a PLS (GS) and pokes holes using any of the 3 methods.
generatecnf.sh  - Generates a CNF from a PLS file
generatepls.sh  - Generates a sudoku in a PLS file (not poked)

Usage of generatesudoku is as follows:

generatesudoku.sh <rows> <columns> <shuffles> <method> <holes> <seed> <shuffles2>

<rows>       - rows of sudoku region
<columns>    - columns of sudoku region
<shuffles>   - shuffles in PLS generating Markov-Chain
<method>     - singly | doubly | fully
<holes>      - # holes in sudoku
<seed>       - random seed
<shuffles2>  - shuffles in Hole Poking Markov Chain

for example:

generatesudoku.sh 3 3 10 fully 40 123 12 

Generates a 3x3 sudoku (9 x 9 cells) with 40 holes fully balanced.
